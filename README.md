# Go By Example: Comprehensive Learning Path 🐹

This repository is a structured, hands-on exploration of the [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) curriculum. My goal is to master the Go programming language by implementing every core concept in a standalone, sequential format.

## 🛠️ Development Environment
- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Format:** Sequential standalone files (`XX_topic_name.go`)
- **Editor:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)
- **Tooling:** `go fmt` for idiomatic styling

## 🚀 How to Run the Examples
Each file is a self-contained `main` package. You do not need to build a complex project structure to run them.

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/msnonari/Go-By-Example.git](https://github.com/msnonari/Go-By-Example.git)
   cd Go-By-Example
